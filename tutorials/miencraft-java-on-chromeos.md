# Installing Minecraft: Java Edition on Chromebooks!

If you have the Play Store on your Chromebook and you have access to download PojavLauncher use the [android tutorial](/tutorials/minecraft-on-android.md) instead.

To install Minecraft on your Chromebook without full access to the Play Store, open Settings on your Chromebook and scroll all the way down to where it says Developers > Linux Developer Environment. ![](/images/t1-c-1.png) If this is disabled you're out of luck. Click on the button that says Turn On and just keep clicking OK until this shows up. ![](/images/t1-c-2.png)

Copy and paste this in there `curl -O https://soldev69.github.io/zeblog/downloads/installprismlauncher.sh && ./installprismlauncher.sh`

That's it! You now have Minecraft Java Edition on your Chromebook!
