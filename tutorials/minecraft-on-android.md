# How to install Minecraft: Java Edition on Android!

Ok this is very easy, firstly download and install PojavLauncher from the Play Store, and sign in to your account. That's literally it. It's 100% safe and working.

If you have any issues or PojavLauncher doesn't show up in the Play Store for whatever reason you can download the apk file by going to [this site](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/actions?query=is%3Asuccess+branch%3Av3_openjdk), click on the first option in the list ![like so](images/t1-a.png), download the `app-debug.zip` file ![](images/t1-a-2.png), unzip that and install `app-debug.apk`. You might need to enable installing apps from unknown sources first.
