# How to install Minecraft: Java Edition on iOS!
## **PLEASE NOTE THIS IS UNTESTED! I DON'T HAVE AN IOS DEVICE AND THEREFORE HAVE NO WAY OF ACTUALLY PROVING THIS WORKS! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR DEVICE! If you want more official tutorial for installing PojavLauncher that won't be likely to brick your phone click [here](https://pojavlauncherteam.github.io/INSTALL.html#ios).**
First thing you need to do to do this cursedness is to check which iOS version you have, as it has to have a known jailbreak. Go to Settings, scroll down to General and tap About. You should see something like this: ![Picture of iPhone settings menu. Please note all these pictures are from Apple's site as I do not have an iPhone so the images belong to them Apple please don't take this down.](https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/iOS/ios15-iphone12-pro-settings-general-about-crop.png)

What you are looking for is your software version. If the first number is 14 or if the first two numbers are 15.0, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 or 15.4 use method 1, if not use method 2. If you have an iPhone 8/8 Plus/X or older skip to Method 3.

## Method 1: Trollstore
If the first number (your iOS version) is 14, then follow [this guide](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore/blob/main/install_trollhelperota_arm64e.md). Afterwards download the PojavLauncher ipa from [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/releases/download/v2.1rc1/net.kdt.pojavlauncher-2.1.ipa). Press share and select TrollStore. That should be it.

## Method 2: Altstore
This is slightly more complicated. If you have Windows follow [this guide](https://faq.altstore.io/getting-started/how-to-install-altstore-windows) to install Altstore. If you have a Mac use [this guide](https://faq.altstore.io/getting-started/how-to-install-altstore-macos). This requires an Apple ID and the ability to sideload apps. Follow [this link](altstore://install?url=https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/releases/v2.1rc1/download/net.kdt.pojavlauncher.ipa) to install PojavLauncher.

## Method 3a: Sideloading
This is probably the most jank method on this list, as it isn't officially confirmed to work. Follow [this guide](https://www.fitzweekly.com/2016/03/sideloading-deb-files-without-jailberak.html) with [this deb file](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/releases/download/v2.0.1/net.kdt.pojavlauncher.release-rootless_2.0.1_iphoneos-arm64.deb) (note this isn't a debian installer, don't install if if you use Debian/Ubuntu, ChromeOS or derrivatives). If this doesn't work or you don't have a Mac, move on to Method 3b.

## Method 3b: Jailbreaking
This is very device dependent and will require a PC. This is the only method where I will say to use the interwebs and find a tutorial as it varies from device to device, but the main thing is you need Cydia and to be able to install PojavLauncher and any required patches.
