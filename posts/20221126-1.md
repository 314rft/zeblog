# 20221126 : 2. First Update
Hello, firstly happy late thanksgiving to anyone from the US who sees this. This site has been updated a bit, I have a bunch of tutorials planned, hopefully a few of them I'll actually write myself instead of just linking to external sources. I'll probably be posting a tutorial on getting Sodium set up on PojavLauncher at some point this weekend or on Monday. I also have a planned 64 bit mod download site planned for all Minecraft 64bit mods released so far.

For those of you who don't know what 64bit mods are, they let you travel over trillions of blocks out without breaking the game. ![I am 10 trillion blocks out in this image.](/zeblog/images/12564b-v6.1.png)
Try doing that Bedrock users!


## Pojav Performance!
I have also prepared a PojavLauncher modpack that lets you play with Sodium and Sodium Extras. Here is the download link [https://soldev69.github.io/zeblog/downloads/pojavlauncher-performance.zip](https://soldev69.github.io/zeblog/downloads/pojavlauncher-performance.zip). Just download this and copy the folders inside to your .minecraft folder in pojavlauncher, on android this is at `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch/files/.minecraft` if you installed from Google Play or `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch.debug/files/.minecraft` if you have the apk. Most Android file explorers will open to `/storage/emulated/0` if you try viewing Internal Storage, if these folders are blocked try using FX File Explorer, which you can get from [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx), after installing that you should see a home menu with a button labeled "Main Storage", tap on that. You might need to enable hidden folders to view .minecraft, do that by tapping on the 3 dots on the top right and tapping "Show Hidden". 

Here is Minecraft running at 30fps on my Galaxy J8 with a Snapdragon 450 processor that lags on Roblox and Discord. Be warned, PojavLauncher will burn through your battery if you use it for too long. ![PojavLauncher running at 30fps on my potato Galaxy with 50ms ticks](/zeblog/images/pojav-pack-1.jpg) A dedicated article or video will probably be coming out later this week on how to install this.
