# 20221215 : 3. Merry Christmas!
If you celebrate it that is. This is probably going to be my last post before Christmas since I keep forgetting to update the blog. 

I added a PrismLauncher install script for an easy install of PrismLauncher and Java 8/17 in [downloads](/downloads/installprismlauncher.sh) (hopefully this link will work first time) and there are a bunch of 64bit mods in here too. I will add a download link to them soon.
