# 20221124 : 1. Intro
Hello peoples and places and things. This is my first blog post on here, I made this blog as an alternative to the failed Connection Terminated project that I was going to be co-editing with a few friends, and as far as I know that blog is dead as I left it over 2 months ago and I would probably know if it launched by now. This is where I'll be posting downloads for things as well as personal updates and project updates. The blog is launching with an untested tutorial on installing Minecraft Java on iOS as well as a tutorial for Android.
